# Movie Picker

* How it works
  - Two lists: unseen.txt and seen.txt
  - Each line is a movie
  - Lines are taken (randomly) from the unseen list and moved to the seen list

* How to use
  - Randomly select a movie to watch from a list: `./sample.rb`
  - If you want to undo use git: `git checkout .`
  - If you want to reset (start with all movies unseen): `./reset.rb`
